# Lab exercise

This repository contains the exercise done for the course Methods and Models for Combinatorial Optimization.

`report.pdf` explains in detail what the exercise is about and what was done for it.

## Summary

The exercise asks to implement a model through cplex C API and an ad-hoc optimization algorithm to solve the TSP.
The implemented ad-hoc algorithm is a simple local search.
